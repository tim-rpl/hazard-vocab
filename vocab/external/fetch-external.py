"""Cache the external vocabularies this project binds, and verify them.

    fetch-external.py            fetch, verify, write manifest.md
    fetch-external.py --check    verify the CACHE only; no network

**This is P5's caching clause, started early.** P5's `done_when` reads
*"all external terms are content-verified by fetch-and-grep; external
graphs are cached locally."* Those are one operation, so this does both
and records the result.

**Why fetch-and-grep and not a status code.** A 200 proves a server
answered, not that a term exists. `http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/thisTermDoesNotExist`
returns a payload byte-identical to a real term's, `qudt:unit` did not
exist, OMS returns a 288-byte stub with zero occurrences of the term it
was cited for, and the ENTSO-E URI 404s. Three of this project's own
bindings were falsified that way. So every entry below carries the terms
it is bound for, and the manifest records **which terms were found in
the payload**, not that the payload arrived.

A term recorded as MISSING is a claim about the payload, and it is
checked before it is reported. This line first read *"a term recorded as
MISSING is not a bug in this script — it is the finding"*, and the next
run produced two false MISSINGs from this file's own `\\b` anchoring
against names containing underscores. **The matcher is a suspect like
any other instrument.** Grep the payload for the real name before
reporting an absence.
